Welcome to NGINX App Protect's Lab Guide Draft!
===============================================
In this class, we will deploy a modern application (Arcadia Finance app) with modern tools in a modern environment.

Each module can be used independently. They do not build on each other.

Module 5: API Security has been recently updated and contains examples of API protections using both NGINX on a centos VM as well as using Kubernetes Ingress Controller. If you only do one section, do that one. You could even do that module first and then come back to the other modules.

Module 1 does not have any commands that need to be run. It is meant to give you background of the application and environment.

Modern tools:
Ansible
Terraform
Gitlab and Gitlab CI
Modern environment:
Kubernetes
Docker containers with docker registry
