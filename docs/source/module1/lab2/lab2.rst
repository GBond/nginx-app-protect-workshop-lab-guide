Topology of the Arcadia Application
###################################

This is a representative diagram of the topologies we will be deploying as part of this lab. In the lab there is only a single node cluster (Node 1).

We will first protect the Arcadia application with NGINX App Protect on a Centos VM. Then we will create a docker container to do the same- just an alternative to using a full VM. 

In Module 5 Lab 2 we will instead use the NGINX Ingress Controller. We will provide more details on how that works then.
