Step 16 - Bot Protection
########################

Bot signatures provide basic bot protection by detecting bot signatures in the ``User-Agent`` header and ``URI``. The bot-defense section in the policy is ``enabled`` by default. 

Each bot signature belongs to a bot class. Search engine signatures such as ``googlebot`` are under the trusted_bots class, but App-Protect performs additional checks of the trusted bot's authenticity. 
If these checks fail, it means that the respective client impersonated the "search engine" in the signature and it will be classified as ``class - malicous_bot``, ``anomaly - Search engine verification failed``, and the request will be blocked, irrespective of the classâ€™s mitigation actions configuration. 

An action can be configured for each bot class, or may also be configured per each bot signature individually:

#. ``ignore`` - bot signature is ignored (disabled)
#. ``detected`` - only report without raising the violation - VIOL_BOT_CLIENT. The request is considered legal unless another violation is triggered.
#. ``alarm`` - report, raise the violation, but pass the request. The request is marked as illegal.
#. ``block`` - report, raise the violation, and block the request

.. note :: We could stop the lab here, and run Bot requests. As Bot protection is ``enabled`` by ``default``, the default protection will apply. But in order to understand to customize the config, let's create a new Policy JSON file.


**Steps for the lab**

#. SSH the centos-vm
#. Test to see if NGINX is running by ``curl 0`` if you get response that looks like html, it is running. Otherwise run: ``/home/centos/lab-files/lab-script-cheat.sh``

#. View our new NAP policy JSON file with Bot protections:

   .. note :: The default actions for classes are: ``detect for trusted-bot``, ``alarm for untrusted-bot``, and ``block for malicious-bot``. In this example, we enabled bot defense and specified that we want to raise a violation for trusted-bot, and block for untrusted-bot.

**Generate simulated Bot traffic** 

#. On the jump host browser ``Arcadia Links>Arcadia NAP CentOS``
#. Now, on the ``Desktop``, launch ``Jmeter``
#. In Jmeter, open the project in ``File`` >> ``Open Recent`` >> ``HTTP Request Bots.jmx``. This file is located in folder Desktop > lab-links > jmeter_files

   .. image:: ../pictures/lab1/open_recent.png
       :align: center
       :scale: 70%

#. Now, run the project by click on the ``GREEN PLAY BUTTON``

   .. image:: ../pictures/lab1/play.png
       :align: center

#. THe project is sending HTTP requests to the NAP with a public IP address (known as ``bad reputation``) and with a Bot ``User-Agent``. We will simulate bots by changing the user agent.
#. You can expand ``Thread Group`` and click on ``View Results Tree`` to see each request sent.
#. Now, go to ``Kibana`` from ``Firefox Browser``, Click on Dashboards then ``Overview`` dashboard.
#. You can notice Good and Bad request in the widgets, but let's focus on the logs at the bottom of the dashboard
#. Open the logs in full screen

   .. image:: ../pictures/lab1/full_screen.png
       :align: center

#. Look at the logs, and open up one or two logs ``alerted`` or ``blocked``. You can notice the ``Bot Category``, the ``violation`` ...

   .. image:: ../pictures/lab1/log.png
       :align: center

.. note :: Now, your NAP is protecting against ``known bots`` and you can customize your policy in order to make it more strick or not.
