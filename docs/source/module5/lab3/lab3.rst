Step 14 - Explore the lab tools for monitoring NGINX Plus

#. In the browser, click ``Arcadia links>WAF NGINX Ingress`` bookmark (you may have to refresh on the browser if you get an error)
#. You are now connected to the Arcadia App through the Kubernetes Ingress Controller with NAP
#. Send an attack (like a XSS in the address bar) by appending ``?a=<script>``
#. Open ``Kibana`` bookmark and click on ``Discover`` to view the logs

#. View the dashboard in Kibana: ``Firefox>Kibana>Dashboard>Overview``

    .. note:: While monitoring is not solely an API security concern, having a real-time dashboard is helpful in understanding current issues and traffic load. In the following steps, we will look at the NGINX Plus dashboard to see how it can help.

#. In the browser, open ``NGINX Plus Dashboards>k8s NGINX+ Dashboard``

#. Note the tab for ``HTTP Zones`` where we can see the Ingresses and VirtualServers deployed for ``k8s.arcadia-finance.io`` and the real-time metrics. You can change the refresh interval by clicking the gear in the upper-right corner.

#. At the top of the menu, click the link for ``HTTP Upstreams``. Here you can see the pods that are part of each of the Arcadia micro-services.

    .. image:: ../pictures/nginx-plus-dashboard-upstreams.png
        :align: center


    .. note:: We have only deployed 1 pod per service. In production environments, it is common for there to be many pods per service and the KIC will load balance them.

#. Optional: Scale the ``app2`` deployment to 3 pods and view the dashboard again.

    .. code-block:: BASH
    
       kubectl scale deployment app2 --replicas 3
    

    .. note:: When pods are scaled up and down, NGINX Plus does not have to reload as it uses an internal API call to update the upstreams- dramatically reducing overhead in dynamic environments.
