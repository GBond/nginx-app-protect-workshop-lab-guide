Step 12 - Protect Arcadia API with NGINX App Protect on a centos VM
###################################################################


The Arcadia web application has several REST APIs in order to:

    #. Buy stocks
    #. Sell stocks
    #. Transfer money to friends

Because we have an ``OpenAPI specification file`` we can use this for a very accurate policy for protecting these APIs.

You can find the ``Arcadia Application OAS3`` file here : https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/nginx5/api-arcadia_finance/2.0.2-oas3

App Protect allows you to reference the file on an external http server or locally on the file system of the NGINX instance.

.. note :: Notice that the URI, method, and response type are all defined for each API. This also serves as a tool for developers to understand what the response should look like for a successful call.

Steps for the lab
*****************

.. note :: Make sure NGINX is installed on centos-vm. There is a script on the centos-vm in /home/centos/lab-files/lab-script-cheat.sh that you can use to easily install App Protect and continue on from here.

#. Use vscode or SSH to the centos-vm

#. Verify NGINX is installed, if the below command returns some html, it is running

    .. code-block:: bash

        curl 0

#. If curl is unable to connect, run this 

    .. code-block:: bash
        
        /home/centos/lab-files/lab-script-cheat.sh

#. View our API policy template that is installed with app protect

    .. code-block:: bash

        cat /etc/app_protect/conf/NginxApiSecurityPolicy.json

#. The required edits have already been made in our file located in ``cat /home/centos/lab-files/openAPI/NginxApiSecurityPolicy.json`` see the highlighted line below.

    .. code-block:: js
        :emphasize-lines: 11

        {
        "policy" : {
            "name" : "app_protect_api_security_policy",
            "description" : "NGINX App Protect API Security Policy. The policy is intended to be used with an OpenAPI file",
            "template": {
                "name": "POLICY_TEMPLATE_NGINX_BASE"
            },

            "open-api-files" : [
                {
                    "link": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nginx-architects/kic-example-apps/main/app-protect-openapi-arcadia/open-api-spec.json"
                }
            ],

            "blocking-settings" : {
                "violations" : [
                    {
        ...

#. See the new sections of the NGINX configuration below for the REST API locations that we will protect

    .. code-block:: nginx
        :emphasize-lines: 11,17

        # app3 service
        location /app3 {
            proxy_pass http://arcadia_ingress_nodeports$request_uri;
            status_zone app3_service;
        }

        # apply specific policies to our API endpoints:
        location /trading/rest {
            proxy_pass http://arcadia_ingress_nodeports$request_uri;
            status_zone trading_service;
            app_protect_policy_file "/etc/nginx/NginxApiSecurityPolicy.json";
        }

        location /api/rest {
            proxy_pass http://arcadia_ingress_nodeports$request_uri;
            status_zone trading_service;
            app_protect_policy_file "/etc/nginx/NginxApiSecurityPolicy.json";
        }

#. Copy the configuration files into /etc/nginx:

    .. code-block:: BASH
    
        cp ~/lab-files/openAPI/NginxApiSecurityPolicy.json ~/lab-files/openAPI/nginx.conf /etc/nginx


#. Restart the NGINX service and then we will run some tests

    .. code-block:: BASH
        
        sudo systemctl reload nginx

Test The Protections
********************

    #. RDP to the jumphost with credentials ``user:user``
    #. Open ``Postman``
    #. Open Collection ``Arcadia API`` (see image below for navigating Postman)
    #. Send your first API Call with ``Last Transactions``. You should see the last transactions. This is just a GET.

       .. image:: ../pictures/lab1/last_trans.png
           :align: center
           :scale: 100%

    #. If you look closely at the OAS3 (Open API Spec v3) file, you'll see that buy stocks expects a POST. Try running ``POST Buy Stocks`` and see that it returns success. If you change the method to ``GET`` and run it again you will notice it is blocked. You can check the request content (headers, body), and compare with the OAS3 file in SwaggerHub.

We will view the logs in the Kibana dashboard in the next lab, or feel free to go to ``Firefox>Kibana>Dashboard>Overview`` now.
